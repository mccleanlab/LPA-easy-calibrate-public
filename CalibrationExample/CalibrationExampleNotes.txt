This folder contains the following example files for performing one round of LPA calibration:
	examples of raw LED measurements acquired using a Thorlabs power meter ('LPA5_IRIS2000_round1_ch1.csv' and 'LPA5_IRIS2000_round1_ch2.csv')
	example of the figures generated by the MATLAB script 'LPA_calibrate.m' ('Fig1_Round1-identifiedWells.fig'and 'Fig2_Round1_IntensityMap.fig')
	examples of the calibration parameters exported by the MATLAB script ('gcal_round_1.csv' and 'meanIntensities_round_1.csv')

To try them out do the following:
	1. Run the MATLAB script 'LPA_calibration.m' to calibrate 'gcal' as described in the MethodsX article 'Easy calibration of the Light Plate Apparatus for optogenetic experiments.'
	2. When prompted, load:
		'LPA5_IRIS2000_round1_ch1.csv' (raw channel 1 measurements corresponding to the top set of LEDs)
 		'LPA5_IRIS2000_round1_ch2.csv' (raw channel 2 measurements corresponding to the bottom set of LEDs)
	3. Within MATLAB, the script should generate:
		Figure 1: shows which LPA wells were identified from the measurements (should look like the included 'Fig1_Round1-identifiedWells.fig' example)
		Figure 2: shows a map of the measured LED intensities for each well (should look like the included 'Fig2_Round1_IntensityMap.fig' example)
	4. The script should also export:
		'gcal_round_1.csv': the set of gcal values that should be loaded onto the LPA to reduce irradiance variation between wells (values are interleaved horizontally to match the format used by Gerhardt et al)
		'meanIntensities_round_1.csv': shows the mean irradiance of each LED (the same information as in Figure 2, though the values are interleaved horizontally)
